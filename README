To run, create a file ~/quileecherc.
Each line in this file can define value for one of those keys :
- hostname : the local hostname (as of the interface you'll listen on)
- ssh_no_users : a comma-separated list (without spaces) of directories in /home that MUSTN'T appear in the sshd filter
- default_filters : a comma-separated list (without spaces) of program names to filter
Syntax to assign values to a key is :
key = value
Spaces around key and values are optional.
No comment, no empty line in the rc file.
To install, just drop the scripts in a safe place (e.g. /usr/local) and symlink qui_leeche.py anywhere in the $PATH.
